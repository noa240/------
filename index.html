<article>
<p class="text">Joanne "Jo" Rowling, best known by her pen name J.K. Rowling, is a British author who achieved worldwide fame for creating the beloved Harry Potter series. Born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, England, Rowling's journey to literary stardom was not without its challenges. Before the success of Harry Potter, she faced personal hardships, including divorce and financial struggles, which significantly influenced her writing.</p>
<p>Rowling's iconic creation, Harry Potter, first came to her imagination during a delayed train journey from Manchester to London in 1990. Over the next several years, she meticulously planned the seven-book series, mapping out the intricate wizarding world and its captivating characters. "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" (published as "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" in the US) was released in 1997, marking the beginning of a cultural phenomenon.</p>
<p class="text">Throughout her career, J.K. Rowling has been a vocal advocate for various social causes, including children's welfare and poverty. Her philanthropic efforts have led her to co-found the charity Lumos, aimed at supporting disadvantaged children around the world and promoting deinstitutionalization of child care.</p>
<p>Despite the immense popularity of the Harry Potter series, Rowling has also faced criticism and controversies. In recent years, her remarks on social media about certain social issues have sparked heated debates, leading to divisions among her fans and critics.</p>
<p class="text">Beyond the wizarding world, J.K. Rowling has tried her hand at different genres, including crime fiction, using the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. With her Cormoran Strike series, she demonstrated her versatility as an author and continued to captivate readers with compelling storytelling.
